                    <span>
                        Validator nodes are the underlying security for POS
                        chains. This is why we take extra measures by using only
                        the most recent, secure and reliable hardware equipment
                        for running our nodes to prevent hacking or system
                        downtime, ensuring security for both the network and
                        userâ€™s staked assets.

                        Apart from the security of our nodes, we have also made
                        moves to ensure users make guaranteed returns when they
                        stake with us, regardless of the current state of the
                        crypto market, by employing the services of leading fund
                        administrators and accounting agencies in the space.

                    <h2><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></h2>

                    <span>
                        <h3>What is proof of work and proof of stake?</h3>
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        The reason Bitcoin consumes so much energy is its
                        application of the Proof of Work consensus mechanism,
                        which is how it protects its network and guarantees
                        decentralization. In other words, the purpose of the
                        consensus mechanism is to ensure all bitcoin miners
                        agree on a legitimate copy of transactions, eliminating
                        the chances that wrong or dubious transactions will be
                        recorded and also guaranteeing no one party has sole
                        control of the network.
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        To do this, miners have to compete by solving complex
                        mathematical problems and the one who reaches the
                        correct answer first is rewarded with extra bitcoin.
                        This is a very complex and energy-consuming process as
                        the miners who didn't get the answer have, anyway,
                        consumed a lot of electrical power.
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        But with the creation of Peercoin (the first proof of
                        stake blockchain) in 2012, the world has seen a shift to
                        a cleaner method of consensus on blockchain networks.
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        Proof of stake chains achieve consensus by requiring
                        that miners stake a required amount (e.g. 32 eth for
                        Ethereum 2.0) of cryptocurrency for a chance to validate
                        transactions on the network. The higher cryptocurrency
                        staked, the higher their chances and the more they get
                        rewarded with additional cryptocurrency.
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        This discourages malicious behavior on the part of
                        miners, as miners can easily lose their stake (slashing)
                        if they validate erroneous transactions.
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        <h3>Which cryptocurrency will earn staking rewards?</h3>
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        Any cryptocurrency/coin whose native blockchain uses the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism can earn staking rewards, but users will have to settle for our list of available cryptocurrencies. As AlphaStake continues to grow, we will add more cryptocurrencies to the list.  
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        <h3>What determines my staking rewards?</h3>
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        When users lock their cryptocurrency in any of our staking pools, they are given access to passive income rewards, which are calculated by:<br />
                        1. Annual percentage yield (APY) of that chain. <br />
                        2. The amount of cryptocurrency being staked.<br />
                        3. The duration of the staking period.
